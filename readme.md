## Supernote web viewer

Online version at: https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-web-viewer/

All transformations occur directly in your browser (your notes remain private and are not transmitted to any server)

Itâ€™s powered by the [supernote-typescript](https://github.com/philips/supernote-typescript/tree/main) library, which is
based on [Tiemen/supernote](https://gitlab.com/Tiemen/supernote) and the
original [supernote-tool](https://github.com/jya-dev/supernote-tool).
